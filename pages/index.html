          <h1>Workshop Description</h1>

          <p>Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of supervised methods of statistical
            natural language processing.
            The <b>L</b>inguistic <b>A</b>nnotation <b>W</b>orkshop (LAW) is the
            annual workshop of the <b>ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation
              (<a href="https://sigann.github.io/">SIGANN</a>)</b>, and it
            provides a forum for the presentation and discussion of innovative research
            on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including the creation and evaluation of
            annotation schemes, methods for automatic and manual annotation, use and
            evaluation of annotation software and frameworks, representation of
            linguistic data and annotations, semi-supervised “human in the loop”
            methods of annotation, crowd-sourcing approaches, and more. As in the
            past, the LAW will provide a forum for annotation researchers to work
            towards standardization, best practices, and interoperability of
            annotation information and software.</p>

          <h4>Author Responsibilities</h4>
          <p>Papers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. Papers must be anonymized to support double-blind
            reviewing. If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated on the submission form but not in
            the paper itself. There will be an anonymity period during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed.
